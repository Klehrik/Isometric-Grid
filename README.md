I wanted to try making 3D games in GameMaker for some reason, so this is basically an attempt at pseudo-3D projection using a bunch of trig.  
I remember trying to make the camera rotate in ways other than around the centre, but I wasn't able to figure it out.  
I was however able to figure out how to draw a volumetric cube in any 3D angle using 4 triangles (under scripts/Quads), which I was quite proud of (originally I just drew a bunch of stacked 2D quads on top of each other, which quickly resulted in performance issues).

Eventually this project evolved into the basis for an [isometric tactics game](https://github.com/Klehrik/Iso4X).
